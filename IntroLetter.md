To whom it may concern,

My name is Josh Jelen, I have been a student here at Algonquin College within the Mobile Application Design & Development program (MAD&D) for the past two years; learning the skills to become a mobile developer. I am writing you for the purpose of sharing my portfolio to demonstrate my ability within the realm of technical writing, and in turn, to obtain the credit for ENL8720.

I have prepared this portfolio by collecting documents, emails, reports, and documentation from current and past careers to showcase my capability with technical writing. While also demonstrating what I have learned over the years and now apply within an office environment on a daily basis as a Junior Mobile Developer for Health Canada.

This letter is simply to provide you with the context and purpose for what is being submitted. I thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.

<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,  
<br/>
<br/>
Josh Jelen
