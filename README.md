# International Experts Groups of Biosafety and Biosecurity Regulators (IEGBBR)

International Experts Groups of Biosafety and Biosecurity Regulators (IEGBBR) - Compendium of International Oversight Mechanisms Related to Biosafety and Biosecurity  of Human and Animal Pathogens and Toxins


----------


The International Experts Group of Biosafety and Biosecurity Regulators (IEGBBR) coordinates and leads concurrent projects related to the international alignment, strengthening, and advancement of biosafety and biosecurity regulatory oversight mechanisms, under the leadership of the Centre for Biosecurity (CB), Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).

It is an initiative of Government of Canada (GC), PHAC is leading the work and is receiving funding from Global Affairs Canada. As previously mentioned, it aligns well with CB mandate, mission, vision, etc. However, it is also important for this group and its work to have its own branding, so that it is understood that it is international work, though the work is lead and funded by GC.

Currently, there is no plan to publish the document on the web. Only the mobile app will be publicly available. The document itself is highly complex and the app will be a much more useful tool to provide the information in a search-able format.

We are doing the mobile app version so that we can provide a link to the mobile app on the IEGBBR’s future public website. It can be branded HC/PHAC and IEGBBR, but the plan is for it to be promoted at the public IEGBBR website and thus not housed in its entirety by any one member’s federal government.

## Application Documentation
**[Documentation](https://github.com/hc-sc/IEGBBR/blob/development/Documentation.md)**

**IEGBBR Compendium of International Biosafety and Biosecurity Oversight Mechanisms**

- Off-line is fine; online not necessary
- No requirement for login
- The app would serve as a reference tool to call up the desired information from a 200 page document
- The document describes the biosafety and biosecurity oversight mechanisms in 11 countries, divided into a number of sections,           e.g., statutes and regulations; notifications and reporting, laboratory inspections
- The information to be presented could be put into a large spreadsheet or database, with the information captured by country             and section
- Examples of the types of queries/filters: 
  - a user might wish to compare the statutes and regulations of Canada and Japan
  - a user might wish to view all of the information about laboratory inspections across the 11 countries
  - a user might wish to view all of the information captured for the USA
- There will be some figures (perhaps 3 or 4 at most, not overly complicated)
